# Would You Rather - Virtual Interaction Game

## Game Objective and Rules

### Objective
"Would You Rather" is a virtual interaction game designed to be played by a group of people on a video call. While the game interface is controlled by a single player, all participants actively engage in the game by making decisions, giving instructions, or answering questions. The game presents participants with two intriguing alternatives, prompting them to choose one, leading to lively discussions and debates.

### Rules

- **Two Options**: Players are presented with two distinct choices, which can be humorous, challenging, or thought-provoking.
- **Single Player Control**: One player controls the game interface, presenting questions and recording answers.
- **Group Participation**: While one person controls the interface, all participants actively engage by making decisions and discussing choices.
- **Making a Choice**: The group must discuss and select one of the two alternatives that are given. Their decision is final, and if they wish, they should provide justification. The game shows the percentage of the general population that chose the same option as they did.
- **Discussion and Debate**: The group may discuss based on the result of their choice and recuperate or deliberate the results.
- **No Opting Out**: Players cannot refuse to respond; they must decide even if both possibilities are unattractive.
- **Respectful Play**: The game should be played with good humor and respect. Avoid having any potentially harmful or disrespectful conversations.
- **Winning or Score**: The game "Would You Rather" isn't normally one where there is a winner or score. Instead of maintaining score, the emphasis is on having fun and talking to others. This game could, in a way, let you know what your friends think about various choices and could reveal the kind of person they are.

## Technology Stack Used

The game leverages a straightforward yet effective technology stack:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Styling and Layout**: Bootstrap - for enhanced visual appeal and cross-device compatibility.
- **Email Integration**: Emailjs - for seamless email functionalities within the game.

## Reflection 

### Design and Development Process

Our journey began with brainstorming sessions where we deliberated on the game layout and formulated an intriguing set of questions. Once we had a clear vision, we designed a prototype version of the game. This prototype served as our foundation, allowing us to visualize the gameplay and user interactions. As we transitioned from the prototype to the main version, our focus shifted to refining the user interface, enhancing the user experience, and adding aesthetic appeal. The transformation from a basic prototype to a polished game was both challenging and rewarding.

### Challenges Faced

One of the initial challenges we encountered was coordinating among the three team members. Allocating tasks, ensuring everyone was on the same page, and setting up regular meeting times required careful planning. Thankfully, tools like when2meet facilitated this process, enabling us to find common time slots and maintain consistent collaboration.

### What Worked

Our prototype version was a testament to our team's synergy and vision. It functioned seamlessly, validating our core game mechanics and logic. The success of the prototype gave us the confidence to enhance its visual appeal. We invested time in refining the design, experimenting with color schemes, and optimizing the layout to ensure an engaging player experience.

### What Didn't

Initially, we were enthusiastic about incorporating images for each question, envisioning a more dynamic and visually rich game interface. However, as we delved deeper into the development, we wanted to keep the game simple, straightforward, and accessible, so we decided to drop the idea of integrating images.

### Lessons Learned

Throughout this project, we learned the importance of flexibility in design and development. While it's essential to have a vision, being open to change and adaptation is equally crucial. We also realized the significance of effective team communication and the value of iterative development. Starting with a prototype and progressively enhancing it allowed us to test our ideas and make informed decisions. Lastly, this project reinforced the idea that simplicity often leads to a more user-friendly and enjoyable experience.
